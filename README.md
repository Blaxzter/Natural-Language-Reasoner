## Problem Statement and Research Questions

In this project, we want to investigate the possibility of reasoning with a controlled natural language, and our aim is to build a reasoning tool, in the form of a webpage interface, that can perform logical reasoning tasks phrased in a controlled natural language, and also provide explanations for the conclusions it derives.

Specifically, we attempt to address the following research questions:
- Which subset of natural language can be used to reason in semantic natural
tableau method?
- How should the semantic tableau method be adapted to directly reason with
natural language?
- To what extent must the natural language structure be specified and constrained
for the semantic tableau method in order to reason with it?
