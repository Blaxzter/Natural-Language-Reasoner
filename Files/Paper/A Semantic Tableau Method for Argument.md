# A Semantic Tableau Method for Argument Construction

## Abstract. 
A semantic tableau method, called an argumentation tableau,
that enables the derivation of arguments, is proposed. First, the deriva-
tion of arguments for standard propositional and predicate logic is ad-
dressed. Next, an extension that enables reasoning with defeasible rules
is presented. Finally, reasoning by cases using an argumentation tableau
is discussed.

## Introduction
- semantic tableau method can be used to derive proper arguments for claims / conclusions with argumentation tableau

## Preliminaries
- argument
    - is a support for some claim, 
    - support is grounded in data, 
    - relation between claim and data is warrant

Definitions: 
An argument A = (S, \phi) where \phi is the conclusion and S is the Support with supporting elements inside. 
Usally in S |- \phi 

There are these defeasible rules which extend standard logic
- defeasible rules specify that a fact is typically a consequence of another;
- undercutting defeaters specify exceptions to defeasible rules.

Defeasible rules are used in the construction of arguments.
An argument has a complicated recursive definition

To be honest didn't understand 80% of the Prelimnary definitions :D

## Basic Argumentation Tableau
Introduce an argumentation tableau which each node is a set of arguments.
